# Iron_Speciation_Calc

Python tool to estimate melt FeO and Fe2O3 from FeOt, with error propagation via monte carlo simulation.

You will need to download the script "fe_speciation_calc.py" and the excel file "Iron_speciation_calculator_input". The file "fe_speciation_calc_tutorial_workbook.ipynb" contains examples for how the function works, using example data in the input spreadsheet. The file "Iron_speciation_calculator_tutorial_output.xlsx" contains the results you should obtain from running the example data in the input spreadsheet.

#### Input Spreadsheet:

  - Temperature is given in Â°K
  - Pressure is given in Pa
  - Oxygen fugacity is given as log10fO2
  
 #### Available models:
 
  - Irvine & Barager (1971)
  - Le Maitre (1976)
  - Sack et al. (1980)
  - Kress & Carmichael (1991): Eqn 6 & 7
  - Jayasuriya et al. (2004)
